Practices for User Interfaces

#How we work

1. Install [sass](http://sass-lang.com/install) and read the [doc](http://sass-lang.com/guide).
2. One brach per feature. It will be called feature/nameofthefeature
3. **Alex is the one in charge of the merges. DON'T DO A MERGE.**

#Code

* the HTML files will only contain HTML code
